    This function downloads a ZIP archive containing normalized count data and a TSV file

    Args:
        url_counts (str): URL pointing to the ZIP file with normalized count data.
        url_experiment (str): URL pointing to the experimental design (TSV) file.
        experiment_name (str): The base name for the experimental design file (without extension).

# You may want to use/crib off of the summary generator in the DCTA workflow:

# Also the gene expression container might be useful too
# https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-workflows/blob/main/containers/gene-expression/context/main.py

# Sure. Yeah, one way to do this is to format the anatomograms as one h5ad dataset per ftu and then use the exact some processing as was done for HRApop on those.

# Yeah, I think it'd make total sense to format the anatogram data like the HRApop input data. It should be easy enough to format the cell summaries in json lines format like you've been parsing and write a dataset metadata csv like we have on HRApop for that data. We can then easily add it to HRApop or just simplify your FTU workflow.
